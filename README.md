    Hub(SP)->>Spoke(IDP): Service Provider redirects to the Identity Provider.
    Spoke(IDP)->>Alice: Prompt for credentials.
    Alice->>Spoke(IDP): Authenicate Alice credentials.
    Spoke(IDP)->>Hub(SP): Relay back / Callbacks.
    Hub(SP)->>SPA: Finally Alice is logged to the SPA with JWT (access/id tokens).
```

## Requirements

- Terraform v1.3.3.
- Okta Provider v3.37.0.
- Two Okta tenants, one representing the Hub and the other representing the Spoke.
- `tfenv` Optional, but recommended to manage different version of the `terraform` cli.
- NodeJS v16.17.0 and with `npm`.
- `nvm` Optional, but recommend to manage different version of node.

## Getting started

### Set up your `okta.auto.tfvars` file with Okta API Tokens.

> NOTE: Assuming you have already created or have to two Okta tenants

- `cp okta.auto.tfvars-sample okta.auto.tfvars`
- Get your API Token and past it into the `okta.auto.tfvars` file.

    ```vim
    # Inside the okta.auto.tfvars file.
    okta_spoke_org_name  = "narisaklabs-spoke"
    okta_spoke_base_url  = "oktapreview.com"
    okta_spoke_api_token = "00Y...kx8"

    okta_hub_org_name  = "narisaklabs-hub"
    okta_hub_base_url  = "oktapreview.com"
    okta_hub_api_token = "00K...VuJ"
    ```

- Provision your Okta tenants.

    ```cli
    $ terraform init
    $ terraform validate
    $ terraform plan
    $ terraform apply -auto-approve     # '-auto-approve' flag, if you do not want to be prompted by the cli.
    ```

    or

    ```cli
    # One-liner
    $ terraform init && terraform validate && terraform plan && terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

- Couple actions happen
  - Both Okta tenants have been provision for Hub and Spoke integration.
  - `testenv` containing the ISSUER and SPA CLIENT_ID that generated by the provisioning.

- Test it!

  ```cli
  $ cd react-app
  $ cat testenv  # Display the configuration value.
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
  ```

- Cleanup.

  ```cli
  $ terraform destroy -auto-approve # '-auto-approve' flag, if you do not want to be prompted by the cli.
  ```
