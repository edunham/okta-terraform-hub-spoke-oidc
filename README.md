# Okta Terraform Hub and Spoke with OpenId Connect

Terraform Hub and Spoke with OIDC is my attempt reduce the complexity when it comes to the Hub & Spoke architecture and
configuration particular between to Okta tenants, one acting as
Hub (Service Provider), and the other acting as the Spoke (Identity Provider).

    SPA->>Hub(SP): Request is forward to the Service Provider (Hub).
    Hub(SP)->>Spoke(IDP): Service Provider redirects to the Identity Provider.
    Spoke(IDP)->>Alice: Prompt for credentials.
    Alice->>Spoke(IDP): Authenicate Alice credentials.
    Spoke(IDP)->>Hub(SP): Relay back / Callbacks.
    Hub(SP)->>SPA: Finally Alice is logged to the SPA with JWT (access/id tokens).
```

## Requirements

- Terraform v1.3.3.
- Okta Provider v3.37.0.
- Two Okta tenants, one representing the Hub and the other representing the Spoke.
- `tfenv` Optional, but recommended to manage different version of the `terraform` cli.
- NodeJS v16.17.0 and with `npm`.
- `nvm` Optional, but recommend to manage different version of node.

## Getting started

### Set up your `okta.auto.tfvars` file with Okta API Tokens.

> NOTE: Assuming you have already created or have to two Okta tenants

- `cp okta.auto.tfvars-sample okta.auto.tfvars`
- Get your API Token and past it into the `okta.auto.tfvars` file.

    ```vim
    # Inside the okta.auto.tfvars file.
    okta_spoke_org_name  = "narisaklabs-spoke"
    okta_spoke_base_url  = "oktapreview.com"
    okta_spoke_api_token = "00Y...kx8"

    okta_hub_org_name  = "narisaklabs-hub"
    okta_hub_base_url  = "oktapreview.com"
    okta_hub_api_token = "00K...VuJ"
    ```

- Provision your Okta tenants.

    ```cli
    $ terraform init
    $ terraform validate
    $ terraform plan
    $ terraform apply -auto-approve     # '-auto-approve' flag, if you do not want to be prompted by the cli.
    ```

    or

    ```cli
    # One-liner
    $ terraform init && terraform validate && terraform plan && terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

- Couple actions happen
  - Both Okta tenants have been provision for Hub and Spoke integration.
  - `testenv` containing the ISSUER and SPA CLIENT_ID that generated by the provisioning.

- Test it!

  ```cli
  cat react-app/testenv  # Display the configuration value.
  # ie.
  # ISSUER=https://narisaklabs-hub.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default
  # CLIENT_ID=0oa...p1d7

  # Navigate to react-app/okta-hosted-login
  cd react-app/okta-hosted-login
  npm install
  npm start

  # Launch your favorite browser, ideally Incognito Mode.
  open http:/localhost:8080
  ```

- Cleanup.

  ```cli
  $ terraform destroy -auto-approve # '-auto-approve' flag, if you do not want to be prompted by the cli.
  ```

## Tips & Gotchas

- On "`terraform destroy -auto-approve`" you get the following error.

  ```bash
  ...
  module.hub.okta_app_oauth.spa_application: Destruction complete after 0s
  ╷
  │ Error: failed to delete user schema property favoriteColor: the API returned an error: Api validation failed: updateUserSchemas. Causes: errorSummary: Property favoriteColor cannot be deleted. It is used to populate oidc_client_8c73i16.favoriteColor., errorSummary: Property favoriteColor cannot be deleted. It is used to populate oidc_client_8c73i16.favoriteColor.
  │
  │
  ╵
  ...
  ```

  Re-execute "`terraform destroy -auto-approve`" should resolve it. There is race conditional that is tied to the custom schema and the mapping that is done on that custom schema attribute. Okta API endpoints, particularly when to HTTP DELETES calls are place into queue to be remove from the tenant.
